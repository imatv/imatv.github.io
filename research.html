                            The environmental context in which a memory is encoded can impact its later accessibility by virtue of tagging the memory with unique retrieval cues. We examined whether distinctive virtual environments (VEs) could be used as a means to provide contextual support during the learning of two sets of easily confusable stimuli. Specifically, we taught participants the translations of 50 English words in two pre-experimentally unfamiliar languages: 10 were learned only in Swahili, 10 only in Chinyanja, and 30 in both languages. Participants in the Dual Context group learned each language in a different VE, whereas participants in the Single Context group learned both languages in the same VE. On Day 2, after the fourth VE learning session, participantsâ€™ ability to recall the Swahili and Chinyanja translations of the English words was tested outside of the VEs. One week later (Day 8), participants were reached by telephone and performed a surprise recall test assessing their long-term retention of the foreign words. Our results revealed that while the Single and Dual Context groups showed comparable recall performance when tested on Day 2, the Dual Context group exhibited significantly reduced forgetting when tested on Day 8. This finding showcases how distinctive learning contexts can protect newly acquired memories from succumbing to excessive interference and promote long-term retention. An additional fMRI dataset collected from a separate group of Dual Context participants during Day 2 cued recall should provide further insights into the mechanisms that underlie their memory advantage.

                            Connectivity across regions in the brain can be characterized as either functional (correlated fluctuations in activity as measured by resting-state fMRI data) or structural (white matter pathways as measured by diffusion MRI data). Emerging studies suggest that the connections across brain regions that make up distinct cognitive networks can partially explain individual differences in behavioral traits. Some theorize that a reliable benchmark of intelligence is the ability to identify subtle patterns across distantly related ideas. The Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), a pattern completion task, is one widely used measure of general fluid intelligence. Here, we use a combination of functional and structural connectivity metrics derived from a large MRI dataset [n=127] to examine the relationship between neural connectivity and RPM scores. We used a Support Vector Regression cross-validation procedure to assess the degree to which we could predict a subject's intelligence based on these connectivity values. We were able to account for 14% of the variance in individuals' intelligence scores when using specific combinations of functional and structural connectivity values.

                            We tested the effects of immersion (the sense of inhabiting the virtual world) and presence (the sense of embodying one's avatar) on long-term retention of information learned in virtual environments (VE). While VE are increasingly utilized in pedagogy, there is mixed evidence on the effects of presence/immersion. Some reported that increased presence/immersion resulted in better recall, while others reported the opposite. Most past research examined memory visual-spatially (testing recall of visual information about the VE itself), thus both memory and presence/immersion measures were based on the VE itself, making it difficult to disentangle the relationship between the two. We studied the effects of presence/immersion on verbal memory, thereby isolating the memory task from the VE upon which presence/immersion were based. Participants learned 40 Swahili and 40 Chinyanja vocabulary words over the course of four learning sessions in a richly featured VE. They were tested (cued by English translations) before each exposure, and later tested again outside the VE on Day 2 and Day 8. We found that individuals who reported higher levels of immersion showed significantly greater recall on Day 8 (M=.42, SD=.08), as compared to those reported low immersion (M=.17, SD=.06). However, there were no effects of presence. These results demonstrate that increased immersion, but not presence, during VE learning might facilitate long-term retention.
